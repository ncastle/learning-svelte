<h1>About this site</h1>
<h2>Author: Nick Castle</h2>
<p>
	The purpose of this site is for learning Svelte and SvelteKit. I am learning the basics of how
	svelte works and as I learn different things, I will add them to this site. I am making my way
	through the interactive tutorial as well as the main documentation and will implement the
	different things I come across in different areas of this site.
